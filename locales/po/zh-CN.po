You can do this as arguments on the command line, or preferably, in the environment of the script.  All replacement values will appear in the environment of the script prefixed with THOLD_.  So, for example CURRENTVALUE will become THOLD_CURRENTVALUE, and so on.  The variables include: &#060DESCRIPTION&#062 &#060HOSTNAME&#062 &#060TIME&#062 &#060DATE&#062 &#060URL&#062 &#060GRAPHID&#062 &#060CURRENTVALUE&#062 &#060THRESHOLDNAME&#062 &#060DSNAME&#062 &#060SUBJECT&#062 &#060GRAPH&#062 &#060HI&#062 &#060LOW&#062 &#060DURATION&#062 &#060TRIGGER&#062 &#060DETAILS_URL&#062 &#060DATE_RFC822&#062 &#060BREACHED_ITEMS&#062.  Finally, Host, Data Query and Data input replacement can be made.  For example, if you have a data input custom data called pending, to perform the replacement use |pending|.  For Data Query, and Host replacement use Cacti conventions |query_xxxx|, and |host_xxxx| respectively."
msgstr "如果设置，当thold回退到正常值时，将运行此命令。请输入有效的命令。此外，还有几个可用的替换标记可用于将信息从阈值传递到脚本。它们包括：&lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; &lt;HOSTNAME&gt; &lt;TIME&gt; &lt;URL&gt; &lt;GRAPHID&gt; &lt;CURRENTVALUE&gt; &lt;THRESHOLDNAME&gt; &lt;DSNAME&gt; &lt;SUBJECT&gt; &lt;GRAPH&gt; &lt;HI&gt; &lt;LOW&gt; &lt;DURATION&gt; &lt;TRIGGER&gt; &lt;DETAILS_URL&gt; &lt;DATE_RFC822 &gt; &lt;BREACHED_ITEMS&gt;。最后，可以进行主机，数据查询和数据输入替换。例如，如果您有一个名为pending的数据输入自定义数据，则执行替换use | pending |。对于数据查询和主机替换，使用Cacti约定| query_xxxx |和| host_xxxx |分别。"
